<p> My name is Tommy Gitre, and I am a junior at Torrey Pines High School. I am a part of TPHS ASB, and I'm positive joining ASB was one of the best decisions of my high school career. Outside of school, I enjoy spending quality time with my friends, as well as working. I have two sisters, one older and one younger, a dog, and two wonderful parents. I am very new to computer programming but so far I think I'm enjoying it. i'm looking forward to the rest of the semester and can't wait to graduate high school. </p></br>

	<h2><strong> Web Lession 01 Notes </strong></h2>
	<h3> Introduction </h3>
		<p> 
		For the following HTML weblabs we will be using N++, a free to use notepad program, mainly used for computer programming. Within N++, to use html code, one must use tags. Tags are the language of html, and they completely make up every website. 
		</p><br/>
	<h3> Basics </h3>
		<p>
		In order to code html, you need to use a large range of tags. The &lt;head&gt; tag is used to structure the website with background information that is relatively unseen. &lt;body&gt; is the tag in which all of the information and images of a website go under, including paragraph tags &#40;&lt;p&gt;&#41;, link references &#40;&lt;a href =&gt;&#41;, and image inputs &#40;&lt;img src =&gt;&#41;. In order to end each tag, you must follow up the information with an ending tag. Ending tags most often have a / before the normal tag, for example, &lg;/p&gt; is the ending tag to &lt;p&gt; &#40;In context it would look something like this, &#40;&lt;p&gt; This is sample text &lt;/p&gt;&#41;.
		</p><br/>
	<h3> Some Formatting </h3>
		<p> In order to seperate the paragrpahs of text in html, you need to use a specefic tag. The tag needed is &lt;br/&gt;, this breaks hte two peices of text, and puts the second part a line below. In order to further seperate the text, you can use &lt;hr/&gt;, which adds a line seperating the two peices of text, and makes for a larger gap.
