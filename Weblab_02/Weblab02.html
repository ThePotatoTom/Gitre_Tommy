		<td><p>The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) is a public research university in the Westwood district of Los Angeles, California, United States.</p></td>
		<td>UCLA is a public, comprehensive university. Founded in 1919, it later became the first "branch campus" of the University of California. An internationally renowned research university, UCLA emphasizes interdisciplinary teaching and exposes undergraduates early to research opportunities with faculty. Students can take part in initiatives in the arts, stem cells, nanoscience, international studies, and the environment among other areas. The campus community is diverse and promotes creative and collaborative achievements, debate and critical inquiry, and an open and inclusive environment. UCLA's 419-acre historic campus is located in the Westwood Village area of Los Angeles.</td>
		<td>I'm interested in UCLA for a few reasons. Ever since I was little my dad had been a huge advocate for UCLA, and I naturally got into the family spirit. My father attended UCLA, and it would rock to keep a family tradition. Additionally, I love southern California weather, and I'd imagine it would be hard to stay far away from home for long periods of time.</td>

		<td>Being a Catholic myself, Notre Dame has always been in my head. My grandfather, that I love dearly, went to Notre Dame, and made a lasting impact on how I felt about this college. I take pride in being Irish and I feel as if being a part of a community like this would really make me feel at home.</td>
